# Readme

This repository is a fork from the BasicTS framework (https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/BasicTS) proposed in the work *Exploring Progress in Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Comprehensive Benchmarking and Heterogeneity Analysis* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06119)


Besides some utility edits, two new architectures have been added: 
- STDMAE + DCRNN 
- STDMAE + D2STGNN

This was done as part of my martes's thesis *Prediction of traffic flow levels with Graph Neural Networks*

# Set up 

## ðŸ’¿ Installing Dependencies

Linux is recommended (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS).
Python 3.6 or higher is required (3.8 or higher is recommended).
We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create a virtual Python environment.

```bash
# Install Python
conda create -n BasicTS python=3.11
conda activate BasicTS
# Install PyTorch
pip install torch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# Install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can download the `all_data.zip` file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14EJVODCU48fGK0FkyeVom_9lETh80Yjp?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1shA2scuMdZHlx6pj35Dl7A?pwd=s2xe). Unzip the files to the `datasets/` directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/BasicTS # not BasicTS/basicts
unzip /path/to/all_data.zip -d datasets/
```
